This distributed project has the purpose of improving:

a) the embedded software developing experience;

b) the router performances, ability and reliability.

The word 'distributed' is intended with the same meaning of the git developing system philosophy. 

People are a resource: any knowledge contribution is appreciated. 

The approach is typical learn-to-learn oriented: feel free to join. 

Note that this repository is related to Netgear **D7000 (V1)** revision only.

**D7000 (V2)** revision has different architecture and toolset and compatibility is avoided at all.
